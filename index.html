<h2>Project 1 Logo</h2>
<p> I usually make art in a pretty intuitive way, letting things flow as I go. For this project, I did start with some planning, but as I worked on it, my direction changed a little. However, I kept the main idea and feeling the same, especially with the overall structure of the final logo. My inspiration came from a mix of historical references, the local vibe, and the planetarium itself. I used a color palette that was based on one from an artist’s depiction of Portland, Maine, and I also worked in a subtle reference to the 1970 eclipse, the year the planetarium was built. I liked hiding these little details in the design and am interested in further exploring hidden design elements in the future.
Looking at my work from an outsider’s perspective and reflecting on the feedback I got during critique, one suggestion that stood out was to incorporate the lettering into my design. I had picked a font, but I hadn’t added it yet because I wasn’t sure if it would fit. After hearing Taryn’s feedback, I realized I should’ve gone ahead and tested it, even if I was uncertain. Next time, I’ll create multiple versions of my design in separate files so I can really compare and contrast them to find the most visually effective option.
I also realized that I relied a lot on the green background to tie everything together in the color palette. While it worked once I added the transparency grid, I should’ve considered the whole piece from the beginning so I wouldn’t have to make adjustments later. That way, I can avoid unnecessary second guessing during the process and create with the intention of the final piece being specific.
Overall, I’m pleased with the final outcome. I’m not super experienced with Illustrator so there were definitely moments of frustration, but I was proud of what I accomplished! I liked being able to sneak in subtle design elements, like the historical eclipse reference and the local color palette. It was a great learning experience, and moving forward, I’ll definitely approach things with a bit more confidence and flexibility

 <h2>Project 2 Photo Manipulation</h2>
<p>For my project, I created a dystopian world where AI and tech advancements have overtaken nature, raising questions about sustainability, ethics, and control.
In the first scene, computers are consuming fresh water, symbolizing how tech can exploit essential resources such as freshwater. Even the windmill, usually a symbol of clean energy, is being used for something harmful, showing how innovation can be misused. The air is polluted, and mythical creatures represent extreme genetic modifications raising the question: once we start altering life, where do we stop? Where is the line drawn there?
In the second scene, a robot accidentally develops human emotions and compassion. He finds carrots, one of the last real agricultural resources and in that moment he becomes a threat. The red lights on his body show that he is now marked as an enemy of the system, which strictly controls everything. The landscape around him looks lush and beautiful, but it’s all artificial, a reminder that nature has been replaced with a convincing illusion. Bright surveillance lights track every figure in the scene, making sure no one steps out of line, even if the rules themselves are unethical.
Both scenes depict a future where technology has gone too far, replacing nature with artificial substitutes and controlling people. There are still glimpses of beauty, but they are fleeting, almost like a cruel joke. To bring this concept to life, I carefully planned the compositions. I sourced high quality images of mermaids,cybernetic elements, computers, fish, windmills, backgrounds, robots, people, etc…integrating them with futuristic cityscapes and underwater environments. Photoshop techniques such as layering, masking, and color grading helped merge organic and mechanical aesthetics. I used the paintbrush tool to draw in shadows and light to add depth to the scenes. 
Viewing my work as an outsider, I see that the composition successfully conveys a thought provoking contrast between nature and technology. During the critique, feedback highlighted the strong conceptual foundation and dynamic use of contrasting environments. However, some comments suggested that the shadows in the underwater scene should align more accurately to create a more cohesive and realistic lighting effect. In the robot composition, the lighting on the robot appeared unnatural, which I plan to adjust by refining the light source and shadow interactions.
This project deepened my understanding of the relationship between technology and artistic storytelling. It challenged me to push my compositional skills while maintaining a clear, impactful message. Additionally, I realized how digital art can be a powerful medium for social and environmental commentary. Exploring the balance between realism and surrealism helped me develop a more refined artistic voice, and I plan to continue using these techniques in future projects! I also have a lot more respect for photo editors!
