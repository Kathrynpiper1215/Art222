<h1>Project 1 Logo</h1>
<p> I usually make art in a pretty intuitive way, letting things flow as I go. For this project, I did start with some planning, but as I worked on it, my direction changed a little. However, I kept the main idea and feeling the same, especially with the overall structure of the final logo. My inspiration came from a mix of historical references, the local vibe, and the planetarium itself. I used a color palette that was based on one from an artist’s depiction of Portland, Maine, and I also worked in a subtle reference to the 1970 eclipse, the year the planetarium was built. I liked hiding these little details in the design and am interested in further exploring hidden design elements in the future.
Looking at my work from an outsider’s perspective and reflecting on the feedback I got during critique, one suggestion that stood out was to incorporate the lettering into my design. I had picked a font, but I hadn’t added it yet because I wasn’t sure if it would fit. After hearing Taryn’s feedback, I realized I should’ve gone ahead and tested it, even if I was uncertain. Next time, I’ll create multiple versions of my design in separate files so I can really compare and contrast them to find the most visually effective option.
I also realized that I relied a lot on the green background to tie everything together in the color palette. While it worked once I added the transparency grid, I should’ve considered the whole piece from the beginning so I wouldn’t have to make adjustments later. That way, I can avoid unnecessary second guessing during the process and create with the intention of the final piece being specific.
Overall, I’m pleased with the final outcome. I’m not super experienced with Illustrator so there were definitely moments of frustration, but I was proud of what I accomplished! I liked being able to sneak in subtle design elements, like the historical eclipse reference and the local color palette. It was a great learning experience, and moving forward, I’ll definitely approach things with a bit more confidence and flexibility
