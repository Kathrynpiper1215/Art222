<p> I made some changes to my original design to better reflect Portland while staying true to the core themes of discovery and celestial exploration. One addition is the chickadee, Maine’s state bird perched on the telescope. This detail not only ties the design to the location but also reinforces the theme of observation and curiosity, highlighting the way both birds and space educators/students are keen observers of the world! For the color palette I drew inspiration from Portland’s visual feeling, adding tones from both the city’s flag and a Portland, Maine inspired palette created by Lunch City Studios based on beautiful landmarks. This choice helps ground the design in a sense of place while keeping it visually cohesive. By altering the composition and simplifying the celestial elements, I made sure the telescope and eclipse remain the most striking features. The design itself is now encapsulated within the eclipse which can also be perceived as the dome itself! The final design preserves the planetarium’s mission of exploration while adding subtle but meaningful influences, making it both timeless and locally inspired.
